Implement a script to update the phone number embedded in many of the storeâ€™s HTML pages.



Over the years, the content authors have embedded the number on pages using a wide variety

of punctuation (i.e., (800)438-4357 or 800.438.4357) while others used letter mnemonics (e.g.,

800.GET-HELP).  Some inserted the US country code, with or without surrounding parentheses.

The store has >50K HTML files, all under an NFS /var/www mount point shared by all servers.



Your job is to replace all the old number with one version of the new number:  202-456-1414.

The job needs to be done tonight, while the web servers are running.  You do NOT have to

convert the new number to the existing format used on the page.
